# ScopedVolumeWheel

Small Windows application to alter the behaviour of the volume wheel media key. In Windows, by default, the master volume will be adjusted. ScopedVolumeWheel changes this so that the currently focused window's volume is adjusted in the volume mixer.

## HotKeys

Volume Up: Increases the volume of the foreground window by 2.  
Volume Down: Decreases the volume of the foreground window by 2.  
Shift + Volume Up: Increases the volume of your music player (Spotify.exe by default) by 2.  
Shift + Volume Down: Decreases the volume of your music player (Spotify.exe by default) by 2.

## Options

The music player can be configured by right clicking the ScopedVolumeWheel icon in the system tray. Alternatively, a configuration file is available at `%APPDATA%\ScopedVolumeWheel\config.toml`.
